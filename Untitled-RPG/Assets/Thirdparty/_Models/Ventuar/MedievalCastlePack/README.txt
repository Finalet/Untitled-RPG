Low Poly Medieval Castle Pack
Pack Creator: Ventuar
v1.1.1
------------------------------------------------
To use: Drag and drop prefabs from Prefabs folder into scene and assemble to fit your needs.

**Due to pivot point and import changes in v1.05 and beyond, objects may be shifted out of their previous positions when updating from older
versions. These changes may likely require manual adjustment by the developer to use as they were previously.**

Tip: To achieve intended graphical results in the demo, switch Color Space (Project Settings > Player > Other Settings) from Gamma 
to Linear, and adjust Shadow Distance (Project Settings > Quality) to 300-400.

Note: Package was made and assembled in Unity's built-in render pipeline. HDRP currently not supported. Materials require conversion when 
importing into URP (Edit > Render Pipeline > Universal Render Pipeline > Upgrade Project Materials to UniversalRP Materials). Media images 
and screenshots were built and rendered using Unity's Post Processing Stack v2 and linear colorspace. Email me if you have any questions!

If you enjoy the assets, make sure to leave a review! It's greatly appreciated, and goes a long way in helping the pack reach others.
