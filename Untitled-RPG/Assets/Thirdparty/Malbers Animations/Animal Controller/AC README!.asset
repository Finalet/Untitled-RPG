  - heading: Animal Controller
    text: Animal Controller(AC) is an animation framework controller, root-motion
      or In Place, for any animal or humanoid character.  AC is the base controller
      for all Malbers  Assets, but you can use is on any other asset on the Store. 
      It was built from the ground up with over 3 years of experience to make all
      my assets shine even more with a smooth and modular controller.
