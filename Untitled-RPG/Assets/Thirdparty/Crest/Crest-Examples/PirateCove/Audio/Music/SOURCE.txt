Option 1) A lot of people seem to be confused about this option, so please read this option to the very end to avoid any misunderstanding!

If you are't using the music in a commercial project, or monetizing, the music is free to use. I ask that you please help me in return with a few easy steps! Click the share button on my youtube video and share on your facebook, twitter, google, etc... to help me in return! Also please leave a credit (Please see "how to credit" question below). Also thumbs up my video, and leave a comment. Lastly, it also helps me if you subscribe to my YouTube Channel.	Donating not required, but always appreciated :)

*Note! If you want to use the music with youtube/facebook video monetization, then please read option 2. If you haven't donated before you upload video, YouTube wont allow you to monetize(run ads) on videos with my music, but this doesn't mean you can't still use the music! Also, if you haven't donated, an advert may or may not play before your video if my music is in it.

Lastly, youtube might recognize and notify you about the music, but this is NOT a "copyright strike".

Option 2) You are using the background music in a commercial sense(monetizing a video, using for tv or a theater film). Donation is required in order to get a usage license. Price up to you and your budget! Crediting not required. YouTubers, please see the second FAQ question below for additional details.
