After you've installed the package, a new **Download Asset Samples from Asset Store** button appears on the top. Clicking it directs you to Unity's Asset Store, where you can download the Terrain Tools Asset Sample Pack. The sample pack includes many high-quality Terrain Brushes and Textures to help you begin working on Terrain.
