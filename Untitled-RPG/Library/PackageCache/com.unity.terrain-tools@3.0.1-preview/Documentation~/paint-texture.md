# Paint Texture

Use the **Paint Texture** tool to add Textures such as grass, snow, or sand to your Terrain. It allows you to draw areas of tiled Texture directly onto the Terrain. In the **Terrain Inspector**, click the **Paint Terrain** (paintbrush) icon, and select **Paint Texture** from the list of Terrain tools.

The Terrain Layer Eyedropper tool lets you select a Terrain Layer directly from the Terrain. To use the Eyedropper tool, hold down **Shift + A**, and click on an area of the Terrain to select its Terrain Layer. See [Common Brush controls and shortcut keys](brush-controls-shortcut-keys) for more information about shortcut keys.

**Layer Palette Profile** lets you save and load Material Layer Palettes using a preset Asset file. This allows you to recreate the same Layer Palette from a prior one, and you can share preset files with other team members to expedite Terrain creation. 

The **Layer Palette** reorderable list allows you to change each Layerâ€™s assigned alphamap channel by dragging UI elements. To simultaneously remove multiple Layers, enable the checkbox for each corresponding Layer, and then press the **Remove Selected Layers** button.

Use the **Create New Layer** text field to specify a name for the new Layer to create. After you enter a name, press the **Create** button to save that Layer in the selected Assets folder.
